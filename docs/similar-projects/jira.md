However, it is not the only feature that Jira has. It also has a scrum board view that is more suitable for teams that adopt scrum software development. In this view, the team can see the current sprint and the progress of the sprint. In addition, it is possible to see the backlog of the project. The backlog is a list of features that the team wants to implement in the future. The team can prioritize the features in the backlog and decide which feature to implement in the next sprint.
